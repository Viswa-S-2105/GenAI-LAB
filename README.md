# Overview of Machine Learning and Generative AI Applications

This project explores various areas of machine learning and generative AI, with implementations ranging from supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to deep learning applications and advanced generative AI concepts like large language models (LLMs) and Langchain.

## Contents

### **Machine Learning Techniques**
1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Focuses on training models with labeled datasets.
   - Examples include classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression tasks.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Explores patterns and groupings in data without labels.
   - Examples include clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and anomaly detection.

3. **Deep Learning**:
   - Utilizes neural networks with multiple layers for complex tasks.
   - Applications include image recognition, text analysis, and more.

### **Generative AI Applications**
1. **Language Translator**:
   - Implements natural language processing (NLP) models to translate text between languages.
   - Showcases the power of multilingual AI tools.

2. **Text to Speech**:
   - Converts written text into spoken language using text-to-speech models.
   - Useful for accessibility and interactive voice-based applications.

3. **Spam Detection**:
   - Detects spam emails or messages using supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
   - Enhances user security by filtering unwanted content.

4. **Chatbot (LLM)**:
   - Deploys large language models (LLMs) to create conversational AI chatbots.
   - Capable of understanding context and generating intelligent responses.

5. **Langchain**:
   - A framework for building advanced AI applications that leverage language models.
   - Facilitates chaining tasks like retrieval, summarization, and decision-making.

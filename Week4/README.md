# Anomaly Detection, Image Generation Projects and Text To Speech AI 

This folder contains Python scripts for anomaly detection using clustering algorithms and pipeline-based approaches for generating images with APIs and models.

## Contents

### **Python Scripts**
1. **anomalyKmeans.py**  
   - Implements K-Means clustering to detect anomalies in data.
   - Suitable for identifying outliers or unusual patterns in datasets.

2. **imageGenAPI.py**  
   - A Python script for interacting with image generation APIs.
   - Allows users to generate images based on specified parameters through API calls.

3. **imageGenPipeline.py**  
   - Builds a robust image generation pipeline.
   - Combines multiple steps such as preprocessing, API interaction, and postprocessing of generated images.
4. **TextToSpeech.py**
---

### **README.md**
- Provides documentation and usage instructions for the scripts in this folder.

## How to Use

### **1. Anomaly Detection (`anomalyKmeans.py`)**
- Ensure required libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` are installed.
- Run the script with:
  ```bash
  python anomalyKmeans.py

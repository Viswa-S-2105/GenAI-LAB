# K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering algorithms and provides insights into customer groups based on various attributes.

## Contents

### **Python Scripts**
1. **customer_segmentation.py**  
   - Main script that combines various clustering techniques to segment customers.
   - Includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and visualization of clusters.

2. **hierarchicalSamp.py**  
   - Implements Hierarchical Clustering for customer segmentation.
   - Demonstrates dendrogram creation and cluster formation.

3. **kmeansSamp.py**  
   - Demonstrates K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
   - Includes steps to determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

### **Datasets**
1. **Mall_Customers.csv**  
   - Contains information on mall customers, including attributes like income, spending score, and age.

2. **clustered_customers.csv**  
   - Output dataset with clustered customer groups based on segmentation analysis.

## How to Use

### **1. Run Scripts**
- Ensure the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, etc.) are installed.
- Execute any script using the following command:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py
